            <h2>Programming and Mathematics</h2>
            <p>
                I'm an aspiring software developer with a passion for mathematics. I've always been fascinated by how
                code can be used to solve complex problems and bring ideas to life. I've been honing my skills in C/++,
                Java, Python, and C#. I'm also developing my skills in tools in a variety of domains such as game development
                with the Unity engine, web development with tools such as Django and Flask, I'm excited to bring my knowledge 
                and enthusiasm to a variety of new projects.
                <br><br>
                Although I'm still early in my career, I've already had the chance to work on a variety of personal
                projects, such as Android and Unity applications. I thrive on the challenges that each new project
                brings, and I love learning new things along the way. It's what keeps me motivated and engaged.
                <br><br>
                On this website, you'll find a showcase of my skills, experience, and projects. I've put together a
                growing portfolio of some of my work.
                If you like what you see, or if you have any questions, don't hesitate to get in touch through the
                contacts page.
                <br><br>
                Thanks for stopping by! I hope you enjoy getting to know me and my work.
